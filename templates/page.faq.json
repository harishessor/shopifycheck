To qualify, a product’s ingredients must contain absolutely no toxic pesticides, toxic synthetic herbicides, or chemical fertilizers.<br\/><br\/>Puracy does not list any of our products as \"Certified Organic,\" and the rest of our products are all made using natural and plant-derived ingredients. We don’t believe that organic ingredients are always better than their counterparts. In fact, they can be cost-prohibitive or even less effective.<\/p>"}},"question_zTyyWE":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"Is Puracy vegan and cruelty-free?","answer":"<p>All Puracy products are 100% cruelty-free and vegan.
